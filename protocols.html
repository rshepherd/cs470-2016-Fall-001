        <h3><u>Mailing List, NYU Classes and Piazza</u></h3>

        <p> All students are automatically signed up for the class mailing list, which will be used to announce
            operational details about the course. <strong>The mailing list is not for discussion of the subject
            material.</strong> You can change your options on the mailing list
            <a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/mailman/listinfo/csci_ua_0470_001_fa16">here</a>.</p>

        <p> Students will be signed up for <a href="#" target="new">Piazza</a>,
            which is an online discussion forum specifically for classes. If you have a question, ask it there first, if
            a student does not answer within a short time, I will answer.
        </p>

        <p> There is also NYU Classes (access it via <a href="http://home.nyu.edu">NYU Home</a>) page for the course.
            Your grades will be posted there.
        </p>

        <h3><u>Office Hours</u></h3>

        <p> My office hours are listed on the Home section of this site. If you need to speak to me and are unable make
            it to office hours, then you can schedule a meeting with me and we can talk on Skype.
        </p>

        <h3><u>Grading Breakdown</u></h3>

        <p>Group projects (50%), individual assignments (20%), final exam (30%). Boost for project ownership
            and class & piazza participation</p>

        <h3><u>Grade Disputes</u></h3>

        <p> If you have a concern about a grade on an homework or an exam and want to discuss it with me, do it in
            person during my office hours. Please do not email me about it, as I will just tell you this.
        </p>

        <h3><u>Homework: Late Policy</u></h3>

        <p> Homework must be submitted before the announced date and time deadline for full credit. For every 24 hours
            late you lose 5% (so it is better to submit correct homework late than incorrect homework on time), with a
            max lateness of 15%. Late homework will not be accepted after the late deadline.
        </p>

        <h3><u>Homework: Compilation Policy</u></h3>

        <p> If you turn in a homework that does not compile, it will not be accepted. You can resubmit according to the
            Late Policy.
        </p>

        <h3><u>Email Correspondence Policy</u></h3>

        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Check the school email address on a regular basis. You can simply forward its content
                to another email account that you use regularly.
            </li>
            <li>Use your school's email account to send emails to professors, instructors, TA's, graders,
                administrators, etc. OR make sure that your email address contains your true name,
                not "frabjous@gmail.com", "BabyGurl@yahoo.com" or some other cool alias.
            </li>
            <li>Make sure you included everything you wanted before hitting send. Don't send three emails
                one after another because you forgot something in the first one.
            </li>
            <li>Proofread the text in your email before sending it. Most of the email clients check for
                typos, but they cannot tell if your email makes much sense. Read it, before you send it.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3><u>Academic Integrity</u></h3>

        <p> All students should submit their OWN work unless a group project has been assigned. Any additional
            references that are consulted besides the course text must be acknowledged. Students who violate the policy
            will be reported to the Dean for disciplinary action. If in doubt about consulting other students in the
            class with questions, please ask.

                integrity policy is here. </a>
